Disputes are filed as a result of a disagreement between the Buyer and the
Seller. Disputes arise out of an issue that is raised by either party not
being completely satisfied with the resolution of their complaint/issue.
</p>

It is important that before a Buyer/Seller raises a dispute, they should
attempt to solve the issue. Please note that whenever a Buyer raises a
dispute, the Seller's payment for that order is put on hold immediately until
the issue is resolved.
